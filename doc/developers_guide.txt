Overview
===========
This app lists recipes for camping meals and is categorized into breakfast, lunch, 
dinner, and desserts. Users can view recipes by meal category and then use a search 
bar to search a specific meal or keyword they are interested in. This has directions 
for cooking over the fire and directions for how some meals or parts of meals can be 
prepped at home. 

Users would be anyone who wants non-typical meals for their camping trips. 
Users would gain knowledge for new meals to make while camping. It could help 
alleviate the stress of having to create new meal ideas on their own.

Input would be a user searching for a specific recipe they were interested in making.
Results would be presented as a string with an image

User Interaction Flow
========================
1.The user opens the app, wanting to find a recipe. The app opens to the 
correct size, so users do not need to resize it for all of the information 
to be in view. Users are able to look through all of the recipes based on category. 

2.If a user  finds a recipe they like, they can search by the recipe or a keyword. After 
typing a valid keyword/recipe, they click ‘search’ and a list of potential matches appears. 
They choose a recipe they want to view and click the ‘show recipe’ button. There are three 
buttons to the left of the recipe photo and title where users can choose to see more 
pertinent information about the recipe.

3.If a user tries to search for a recipe that is not valid or they click search without 
typing in anything, they will get a n error message and be prompted to search again.  

Screen shots of this flow are available in the README.md file 

Flow of Code
==============
When a user types a recipe and clicks the search button they are running through 
the print_similar_recipes function. This function compares user input to recipes 
listed in the database of recipes to produce a resulting string or stings. This produces 
unique recipe titles. If someone searches ‘fish taco’, that is compared to the database 
and only produces one result as fish taco. 

This function also contains the command for 
the search button. When the search button is clicked, this function runs. 

When a user selects a specific recipe from the resulting list, and clicks ‘show recipe’,
show_selected, the show_selected function runs. This indexes what recipe was selected 
in the database and pulls the matching title and image to display. It also pulls the 
ingredients, directions, and other details and shows them when the correct button is 
clicked. Show_selected also clears previous information and replaces it with new recipe
information if another recipe is selected. 

Show_ingredients, show_directions, show_others functions all run when the coordinating 
button is selected. 

Known Issues
==============
Print_similar_recipes function could have a better way to match user input to the database.
The current function is a problem, because if you use too many letters the function will 
think there is not a match. For example, if someone searches macaroni, they will get an 
error code because the recipes listed only say mac. 
The current function is okay at this point, but if the database were larger, it would be 
challenging to have to look through all of the recipes to ensure you’re searching for something
that exists. 
Another inefficiency is it would be nice to have the option to click on a recipe in the list
of recipes to search from there, or filtering recipes by category so a user could just look 
at breakfast recipes would be more user friendly. 

Future Work
==============
This project could be expanded to offer a way for users to save recipes they liked. It could 
also offer user reviews and be a multi user app rather than just a single user app.
