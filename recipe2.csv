1.Stir together all marinade ingredients in a small bowl. Place the lamb in a large zip-top bag or resealable container and pour in the marinade, making sure the meat is completely coated. Meat should marinate at least an hour and up to 48 hours.

At camp: 
1.Fire up your grill or get your campfire going. You’ll be cooking the kebabs over medium-high to high heat. 
2.Build your skewers by threading the lamb, tomatoes, and halloumi on their own skewers. Brush the tomato and cheese skewers with oil, and season the lamb skewers with salt. 
3.Once the grill has reached a medium-high heat, place all the skewers on the grate. Grill, turning often, until the lamb has cooked through (about 10 minutes), the tomatoes are soft and beginning to blister (about 4 minutes), and the halloumi is soft and grill marks form (about 3 minutes on each side). Heat the flatbreads over the grill until warm. 
4.n the meantime, make the yogurt sauce by combining the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt.  5.Build your gyros by spreading some of the sauce on each flatbread and topping with the lamb, tomatoes, and halloumi. ",10,15,2,gyros.jpg
